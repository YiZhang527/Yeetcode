# 2D Array / Matrix
A 2D array is a common data structure that represents a table, matrix, or grid, where each element is itself an array.

## Basic Concepts

* **Definition**: A 2D array consists of `m` rows and `n` columns, usually represented as `m x n`.
* **Accessing Elements**: Use `array[row][col]` to access the element at row `row` and column `col`.
* **Storage Order**:
  * **Row-major order**: Elements are stored row by row, with all elements of a row stored contiguously.
  * **Column-major order**: Elements are stored column by column, with all elements of a column stored contiguously (e.g., in Fortran or Matlab).
